    <p id="paragraph">Hello there! My name is Grace and I'm a rising senior from Pennsylvania. I am an aspiring computer scientist and hopeful CS major (although I do think majoring in something in the technologic field would be fun and innovating). I enjoy reading and playing the piano, somewhat cliche hobbies yes but I love them.
